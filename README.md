I use Crowdin default dash. But when i do offline translation then i use [OmegaT](https://omegat.org/). I have added tmx and glossary files for translation. Please pardon me if i make any wrong translation !!!, you can correct me by making a pull request. You can use my tmx file for translating in your projects.

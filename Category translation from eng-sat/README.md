I found some sources where you can get technical translation files for santali such as .po or in them.
1. [Libre Office](https://translations.documentfoundation.org/projects/libo_ui-6-4/scp2sourceooo/sat/) - Needs account to view translation
2. [Inkspace,tuxpaint,.Po files](https://www-staging.debian.org/international/l10n/po/sat)
3. [Pidgin .po files, see attachments on that website](https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/16245)
